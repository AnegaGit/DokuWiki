Use the portal to select the wanted target portal.

**Limitation**\\
  * Teleportation requires a minor spell, every character can perform with a very low amount of mana.\\ Even character with the minimum essence of 0 have sufficient mana for a teleport.
  * Teleportation costs some coins (5 silver).
  * Illiterate character cannot read the portal name
  * If the portal cannot be used, there is no valid target possible.\\ This might be since some portals are inactive at the moment.
