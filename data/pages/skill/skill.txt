====== Skills ======
===== General =====
To learn a skill a character has to perform an action, related to this skill. To learn mining you have to work in a mine.

  * It is not possible to use experience from an action for any not performed skill.
  * The range of every skill is 0-100.
  * Learning higher skill levels requires more effort.
  * The total skill levels are limited.

The possible skill gain depends on the [[misc:activeplaytime|active play time]]. Yo do not learn more when you grind a skill without interruption compared to another character who role play and perform the skill from time to time.
===== Skill Gain =====
==== Calculation ====
As long as the player actively takes part in the game, skill time is collected.

If the character performs any skill related activity, the effective skill time is calculated as follow:\\
  - Calculate a factor (0-1) depending on the difference of the the current skill and the necessary skill for the action (e.g. level of the fought monster, level of the produced item). Within a range of about -10 to +2 difference, the value is 1. The used [[internal:nonlinearcurves|nonlinear dependency]] is number 20.\\
  - Calculate a factor (0..1..n) depending on the relative skill time with an SQRT function.\\
  - The action skill time is multiplied by both factors to calculate the effective skill time.\\
  - The necessary skill time for the current skill level is calculated using a skill related [[internal:nonlinearcurves|nonlinear dependency]]. The default is number 21 but each skill can have a separate.\\
  - The relation fo the effective skill time and the necessary skill time defines the learned experience.\\
  - The learned experience can never be more than 0.9 times the experience needed for a skill step. It is not possible to step up 2 skills with a single action.
===== Level =====
The exact skill level is not shown. The following wording is used in ascending order:
  - noob
  - beginner
  - apprentice
  - assistant
  - journeyman 
  - practitioner
  - adept
  - authority
  - expert
  - master
  - grand master

===== Skill Level Limitation =====
The player has to concentrate to some skills. A skill cap prevents a character to become a master of all trades. A Jack of all trades with a decent level in all skills is possible.

Skill point summary is calculated as 1+2+..+n where n is the current skill level.
^level^summary^
|1|1|
|2|3|
|3|6|
|10|55|
|50|1275|
|70|2485|
|100|5050|
|n|(1+n)*n/2|
The summary of all skill points is limited in a way a character could reach level 62 (2000 summary points) in each skill or concentrate to some prefered skills.

Skills are grouped as well. Each group has a separate skill gap. A player can reach level 70 (2500 summary points) in each skill or concentrate to a selected sill to master and reach a lower level for the other skills.\\
For example the fighting skills are in one group. So a character cannot become a master of all fighting styles.

===== Consequences =====
Having a lot of unused skill time can lead to a multiplication of the action skill effect.\\
Continously performing skill actions lead to very small action effects.\\
==> RolePlay time is not wasted time.

If the action is far below the level of the character, there is no skill gain.\\
If the action is far abouve the level of the character, the actin effect becomes very small.\\
==> Concentrate to actions, related to your skill

You cannot become a master in all crafts or skills, necessery to reach a target.\\
Skilling everything at once slows down mastering a certain skill.\\
==> Concentrate on your strength and work together with other characters who have other strength.
