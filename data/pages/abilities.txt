Every character has different abilities.

Abilities are defined at character creation and must not be changed later.

Each ability can have one of the following values:
  * 0 = Not available
  * 1 = Poor
  * 2 = Good
  * 3 = Excellent

The total sum of all abilities of a char has to be a defined value.
There must be a number of not available as well as a number of excellent abilities.
