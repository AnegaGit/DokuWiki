====== Luck and Chances ======
==== Character ====
The attribute luck influences a number of random effects and alters the skill relevant base value.

Luck can work in both directions.

Luck influences the following activities, though sometimes only in homeopathic doses:
  * Damage, dealt with a weapon 
  * Parry
  * Damage, adsorbed by an armor
  * Gathering, amount of findings and special findings


===== Priciple =====
The priciple is shown as an example for a character with luck 15 and the following weapon:

The Sword of Chaos
  * luck portion: 0.4 (40%)
  * best luck: 2
{{ :luck_process.png?nolink&400 |}}
30% (15 of 20 from luck portion) are good luck, 10% (5 of 20) are bad luck. (Total 40%)\\
The best luck of 2 allows a damage twice as high as normal. Best luck does not affect the bad luck.

In our example 1 out of 10 attacks 'fail' with lower damage and 3 out of 10 attacks are critical hits with up to twice the normal damage.

Items with values of 10 and above for best luck are not really rare.
==== NPC ====
Luck is not applied for NPCs.
