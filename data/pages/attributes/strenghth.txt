====== Weights ======
Item weight is given in gram. A 1 kg item has the weight of 1000.\\
The weight of an item in the game may differ from the weight of the item in reality.

How much a character can carry is defined by an attribute. Some items and events influences the weight.
^Attribute^Effect^Min^Max^Used nonlinear curve^
|Strength|Weight, the character can carry|12.000|120.000|3|
|Strength|Max distance an item can be thrown|20|30|4|

A speed of a character depends on how much a character carry. The nonlinear curve 18 is used.\\
A character cannot move if the weight of all items exceed the weight, the character can carry.

The item weight influences the distance it can be thrown. The nonlinear curve 19 is used.
