Every attribute has a range of 0-20.

A new character starts with 90 attribute points in total. With play time more attribute points can be distributed. Eventually the total sum of all attribute points for a character is 120 (10 each).
===== Combined Attribute =====
The attributes strength, dexterity, agility and perception are combined in different variations for the execution of actions.

For example the damage a mace swinger dealt is influenced as follow:
^ ^share^example character skill^total^
|strength|4|16|64|
|dexterity|2|12|24|
|agility|1|6|6|
|perception|0|9|0|
^total^7^ ^94^
The combined attribute is 94/7=13.
