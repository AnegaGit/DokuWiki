====== Mines ======
Coal, ore and gems can be found in mines.\\
Most are underground mines and require advanced [[abilities:abilitiydarkvision|dark vision]] or light sources.

There are a lot of different vein types and an advanced knowledge is necessary to know whether a vein is a bonanza or just a few lumps of ore.

There are some general properties for most of the veins:
  * As more resources a vein have, as lower is the required skill to work with.
  * Rich veins have a much lower probability to get any extras.
  * It takes more time to respawn as more resources a vein provides.
