====== Races ======
There are 4 different races available:
  * Human
  * Dwarf
  * Elf
  * Orc

The general definition of the breed is based on the Tolkin definition, whereby every race is basically open to all possibilities. So, orcs must not be evil violent and stupid, elves must not be intelligent and kind.

No matter what race you play. At the moment races differ only visually.
