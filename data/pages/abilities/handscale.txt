====== Hand Scale ======
The ability defines how good a character can identify the weight of items.
Tooltips and weight scales are controlled by the ability. The weight or capability to carry weight is not influenced.

**Sometimes you don't realize the weight of a burden you've been carrying until you feel the weight of its release.**
==== Not Available ====
//If it is big, it must be heavy.//\\
Somehow you have no feeling for weights at all. Larger items probably weigh more.\\
You will be surprised again and again if you can not lift your bag anymore. You can roughly estimate in which third the total weight of your equipment is located.
==== Poor ====
//Simplicity is an exact between too heavy and too light//\\
You have an idea of what weighs things.\\
You can also estimate the weight of your bag, though not very exactly. You can roughly estimate in which sixth the total weight of your equipment is located.
==== Good ====
//This is exact one kilo, more or less.//\\
You know the weight of objects. But not more accurate than a single number.\\
The weight of your bag you can estimate with +-10% accuracy.
==== Excellent ====
//This stone bag weighs two grams too little!//\\
It seems like you have a natural scale. You can determine the weight of objects and your bag exactly.
