====== Abilities ======
Every character has different abilities.

Abilities are defined at character creation and can be changed later by GM only.

Each ability can have one of the following values:
  * 0 = Not available
  * 1 = Poor
  * 2 = Good
  * 3 = Excellent

The total sum of all abilities of a char has to be a defined value (18).\\
There must be a number (1) of not available as well as a number (1) of excellent abilities.

While changing th abilities one must first remove one ability value. One cannot add a value if the sum of all abilities exceed the limit or if the sum is equal the limit but the number of Not available and Excellent abilities is not given.

It may be necessary to remove more than one ability value first to achieve the desired result. It may even be necessary to stay with a smaller number of total ability values for a while to do a larger rebuild.
