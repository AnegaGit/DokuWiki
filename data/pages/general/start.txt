===== Idea =====
  * The game is a platform for free role play in an open world medieval fantasy environment.
  * The main focus is player role plays with player.
===== Core Slogan =====
“**We play together, not against each other.**”

===== Limitations =====
  * The characters are not bright heros with unlimited powers. Every character has advantages and serious disadvatages.
===== Design Principles =====
  * The game is not about numbers. The player rarely will see numbers describing the character.\\ For example: The health is not 96%, the character simply is unharmed.
  * Disadvantages are not just role played and can simply be ignored. Disadvantages are anchored in the engine.\\ For example: If the character can not read what makes it impossible to understand signposts, the player too can not.
  * Dependencies are not linear.\\ For example, the additional damage gained through skill gain is not constant over the skill range.
  * The engine provides the environment, the player the content.\\ For example: There are no names for locations defined by the engine except a few exclusions. It' on behalf of the player to name what they want to name.
