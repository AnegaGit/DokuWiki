====== Organize NPC Trade ======
There is a separate tool for organizing the buy and sell list of an NPC.\\
**Anega_NPCMerchants**
===== Data =====
The data are stored in the server based data base but not taken into consideration automatically.\\
The following tables are part of the data set:\\
  * ang_item_info
  * ang_npcmerchant_info
  * ang_buysellgroup
  * ang_buysellitems

The data are structured as follow:
^Level^^^^Data^Data base table^
|0| |||NPC\\ - Name\\ - Buy all sold items as well|ang_npcmerchant_info|
|:::|1| ||Buy| |
|:::|:::|2| |Group\\ - Name\\ - Price level\\ - Sort position|ang_buysellgroup|
|:::|:::|:::|3|Item\\ - Name (ang_item_info)|ang_buysellitems|
|:::|1| ||Sell| |
|:::|:::|2| |Group\\ - Name\\ - Price level if item is bought\\ - Sort position|ang_buysellgroup|
|:::|:::|:::|3|Item\\ - Name (ang_item_info)\\ - Quality\\ - Durability\\ - Price level|ang_buysellitems|
To simplify the structure a NPC can buy all item it sell as well if te related property is set. The price level in the sell group refer to the buy action only!
===== Load base data =====
Merchants and items are load from the game. NPC merchants must be added to the NPC Merchant list under //Editor=>Manage Assets//.

//Editor=>Manage Assets=>Load NPC and items into database//
Items and NPC merchants are added to the main data base. This only applies to tables:
  * ang_item_info
  * ang_npcmerchant_info
The result messages are:
<code>
NPC merchants: 53 items updated (1 warnings in log file)
NPC merchants: 1 NPC updated (1 warnings in log file)</code>
Warnings most likely refer to items and NPC which are listed in the data base but not found in the game. These are not deleted since there might have been name changes or other issues.\\
Please correct the data direct in the data base!
