===== Time Base =====
Since Unity cannot sync DataTime, Long or Double, some time data are based on seconds as int since a date.\\
Anega use GlobalVar.zeroDate currently based on 2020-01-01. This is taken instead of 1970-01-01 to avoid the time running out in 2038.\\ Now it last until 2088-01-19 03:14:07.
