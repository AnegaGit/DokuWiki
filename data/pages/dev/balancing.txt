====== Notes About Balancing ======
===== Gathering =====
Using a tool at the exact skill of the character, the character may get 50% tries to find any resource as parameter //Items in Resource// say.\\
Some of the tries may be void, depending on the parameter //Void Tries Min/Max//. The position in between Min-Max depends equally on
  * the characteer skill related to the tool skill
  * the character attributes related to the skill attributes
  * the tool quality. 
==== Tool Influence ====
The working speed (work time) is in a range depending on the character skill related to the tool skill level.\\
The [[attributes:luck|luck factor]] influences the probability of special findings and increases the amount of items the character can get. 
  * Tools with higher skill level should allow lower work times.
  * Better tools can have higher luck factors.
==== Resource Influence ====
In the same phase there is no skill related difference what items the character find.\\
Items for higher skilled people only should have a seperate phase with higher //Best Skill Level//.\\
If a larger amount of items can be found give more items per try.
=== Special Findings ===
The //Probability Extra Stuff// is taken into consideration only, if the character find anything already. The content is generic.

If some resource specific findings are planned, these findings has to be part of the list of items to find. The probability has to be adapted accordingly.\\ **Example:** Item1 has a probability of 49 and item2 a probability of 1. The character get in 1 out of 50 (49+1) cases item2. That's exact 2%.
